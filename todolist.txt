- this game contains completely oop standarts
- starting with game class
- now player is moving left with an animation, need to optimize the code for the other directions.
    . maybe needs to open playerstate file -//completed
- enemy class need to customize and see it on the screen.// enemy class created and made a basic sample with rectangle.now try with real example. 
// 4 pcs enemy created and they are moving on x direction.
- map need to be created- // map class created and practiced in the game. okay
- dots need to place in to the map area. // okay
- enemies need to follow the player. // okay.
    . ISSUE : enemies getting too close each other // done ----one reddot added as a new tech.
- collision detection // player~wall (done), player~dot (done) and eney~player(done- buffer added)
- score optimization
    . currently performing this by using filter function on array. -done
- pause case - //done
- health optimization
    . flickering enemies as touching the player // done.
    . health image optimezed with touching enemies and game over.
- ui design (now doing that by using css)
    .scoreboard
    .health board
- background
- more optimization
- some visual and sound effects
    . game Over screen Created - // done
    . dust effects
    . sound effects


// new concepts need to apply the code
    . use object in function parameters (destructuring)
    . use spread in array or objects
    . use object.assign

// issue : too sharp transition as aligning the player into the hallway (no need to rush to solve that).
